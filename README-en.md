## üìñ Project Introduction

**TransWe** means `Translation+Wechat`, and it is a powerful machine translation WeChat applet, which can quickly and accurately translate various languages through the background machine translation service. It also supports third-party OCR, speech recognition and speech synthesis integration to provide users with more convenient and efficient translation services.

TransWe features include:

1. Machine translation: TransWe uses the background machine translation service to support multi-language translation, including English, Chinese, French, German, Japanese, Korean, etc., and can accurately and quickly translate user texts.
2. OCR recognition: TransWe supports third-party OCR recognition. Users only need to upload pictures or take photos to convert the text in the pictures into text for translation.
3. Speech recognition: TransWe supports third-party speech recognition. Users only need to record audio, and the speech in the audio can be converted into text for translation.
4. Speech synthesis: TransWe supports third-party speech synthesis. Users can convert translation results into speech output through speech synthesis to improve user interaction experience.

TransWe is easy to use and has powerful functions. Just select the language to be translated, enter the text to be translated, and click the "Translate" button. TransWe will automatically complete the translation. If you need to use OCR recognition, speech recognition or speech synthesis, you can choose the corresponding function button and follow the prompts. At the same time, TransWe is a completely free small program designed to provide users with more convenient and efficient translation services. Whether traveling, studying or working, TransWe can help users easily deal with language difficulties.
